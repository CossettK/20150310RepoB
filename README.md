# Tobias Quality Concepts, LLC (TQC) has been a premier technical consulting firm since 1999. We have specialized in on-site training for many of those years, training thousands of people in hundreds of waves at dozens of companies internationally. As business margins get tighter and tighter, and more firms are gaining global presence, we've brought our world-class training to "the cloud," in the form of LEvEx by TQCâ„¢. Cloud delivery of consulting services--ranging from mentoring and training to project work to full-scale consulting engagements--will save both your company and ours in the two most valuable resources of time and money.
# We believe that neither lack of time, nor lack of funds should be an obstacle to any business looking to improve their operational efficiency. We recognize one-size DOESN'T fit all companies and therefore offer an incremental learning approach, as well as more traditional curriculum delivery approaches. We look forward to the opportunity to assist you during your evolution of excellence.
